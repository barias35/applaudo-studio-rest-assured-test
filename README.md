# This project was a challenge from Applaudo Studio

## How i did it? 

I needed TestNG and Rest Assured i configured [pom file](/pom.xml) with the plugins and dependencies needed,
I also needed "jackson-databind" dependency for mapping json response into a list of class "Character"

*After I finished the configuration i created the [model](src/main/java/models/Character.java), this with the purpose of cast a json response data to a class*

*My next step was create my [testcase](src/test/java/ApplaudoStudioTest.java) class, *
*this was a very challenging task because this was my first time seeing Rest Assured*

*After I finished of creating my testcase, i realize that i repeated these lines in both test cases* ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47786738/124062013-fb3d8b80-d9fd-11eb-997b-3f0c7f321fc0.png)


*Here i just implemented the same method i used in another project using unittest with pytest "SetUp" method is used automatically for unitest when a testcase is run*
*but this time i just implement it with "@BeforeClass" decorator in order to be used automatically for the test runner in Java*

*This is how it look now*

Thank you! Applaudo Studio
