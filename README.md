# This project was a challenge from Applaudo Studio

## How i did it?

*My next step was create my [testcase](src/test/java/ApplaudoStudioTest.java) class*
*This was a very challenging task because this was my first time seeing Rest Assured*

*After I finished of creating my testcase, i realize that i *
