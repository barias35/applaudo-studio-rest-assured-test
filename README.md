## How i did it? 

I needed TestNG and Rest Assured i configured [pom file](/pom.xml) with the plugins and dependencies needed,
I also needed "jackson-databind" dependency for mapping json response into a list of class "Character"

*After I finished the configuration i created the [model](src/main/java/models/Character.java), this with the purpose of cast a json response data to a class*

*My next step was create my [testcase](src/test/java/ApplaudoStudioTest.java) class*,
*this was a very challenging task because this was my first time seeing Rest Assured*

*After I finished of creating my testcase, i realize that i repeated these lines in both test cases* ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47786738/124062013-fb3d8b80-d9fd-11eb-997b-3f0c7f321fc0.png)


*Here i just implemented "@BeforeClass" decorator in order to be used automatically for the test runner in Java*

*This is how it look now*

*Now i can use the request in both cases*


*I used IntelliJ, if you clone this project you must run maven for automatically install dependencies and plugins already in the pom file*

* Then open IntelliJ go to this option

* Then click on + button

* Then select TestNG and the option "Test king" select "All in package"

* You must select the sdk in my case i used Java 11 (11.0.7) if you do not have it [dowload here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html), then install it after installation is completed go to the section on the image below:

* Then run and enjoy it!
