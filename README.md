# This project was a challenge from Applaudo Studio

## How i did it? 

* First [I created the model](src/main/java/models/Character.java), this with the purpose of cast a json response data to a class*
*This was a very challenging task, this was my first time seeing Rest Assured*
*The firt thing that come to my mind was create a Class*
