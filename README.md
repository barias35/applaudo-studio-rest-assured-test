# This project was a challenge from Applaudo Studio

## How i did it? 

I needed TestNG and Rest Assured i configured [pom file](/pom.xml) with the plugins and dependencies needed

*First I created the [model](src/main/java/models/Character.java), this with the purpose of cast a json response data to a class*

*My next step was create my [testcase](src/test/java/ApplaudoStudioTest.java) class*
*This was a very challenging task, this was my first time seeing Rest Assured*

*The firt thing that come to my mind was create a Class*
